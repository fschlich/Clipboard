version: 0.09
date:    Thu Oct 20 09:30:45 CDT 2005
changes:
- Included Anton Berezin's Clipboard::Xclip fix for data that includes \n\n
- Added scripts/clipfilter (also with Anton's feedback)
- Removed dependency on IO::All
- Cheated to make CPAN tests pass (turned 'xclip' dependency into warning).
  The real fix here is probably to Inline::C it - the xclip source is not that
  hard to read and pare down to a minimal set.
